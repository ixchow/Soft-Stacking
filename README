Soft Stacking
-------------
This research prototype allows one to paint with different layer orderings.

For more information about the algorithms used, see:
http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/soft-stacking/

Building
--------
#Linux:
qmake && make
#OSX:
./make.sh

Usage
-----
Click the 'open folder' picture in the layers pane to the right to add layers.
Layers will, by default, be shown in the order they were loaded.
Type in the text box in the mappings panel to define mappings (these re-arrange layer orders).
For example:
"0<1" put layer "0" under layer "1".
"c<a&b" put layer "c" under layers "a" and "b"
"a<b<d" put layer "a" under layer "b" and "d"; put layer "b" under layer "d"

Once you've added a mapping, select it for painting by pressing the brush button near it. You paint with the left mouse button. You can "unpaint" with shift-left-button. Mouse wheel and shift-mouse-wheel change your brush size and softness (as do the sliders at the top).

The 'save' button in the misc panel saves your work -- both the final composite and the mappings.

Bugs
----
This prototype often works for me on Linux; I have experienced occasional crashes on OSX and haven't been able to get it to work on Windows. Contributions of bug fixes are welcome!
